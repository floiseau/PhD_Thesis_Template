\section{Presentation of the template}%
\label{sec:presentation_of_the_template}

\subsection{Numbering of sections}
\label{sub:numbering_of_sections}

\subsubsection{My first subsubsection}
\label{ssub:my_first_subsubsection}

The sections are numbered until the subsubsection.
The numbering depth can be changed in the \texttt{cls} file.

\subsection{An equation}%
\label{sub:an_equation}

This subsection contains the equation of the harmonic decomposition of an elasticity tensor,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:harmonic_decomposition}
    \ela =
        2 \mu \J +
        \kappa \id{2} \otimes \id{2} +
        \frac{1}{2} (\id{2} \otimes \dev{\dil} + \dev{\dil} \otimes \id{2}) +
        \har
\end{equation}
where
    $\mu$ is the shear modulus,
    $\kappa$ is the bulk modulus,
    $\dev{\dil}$ is the deviatoric part of the dilatation tensor, and
    $\har$ is the harmonic part.
Moreover, $\id{2}$ is the second order identity tensor and $\J$ is the deviatoric projector.
You can refer to this equation using the package \texttt{cleveref}\footnote{Guide to \texttt{cleveref}: \url{https://texblog.org/2013/05/06/cleveref-a-clever-way-to-reference-in-latex/}.}.
The \cref{eq:harmonic_decomposition} contains the harmonic decomposition.
\begin{remark}
    The \cref{eq:harmonic_decomposition} uses notations defined in the List of Symbols in the frontmatter.
    Those notations are defined using custom commands in the \texttt{notations.tex} file.
\end{remark}


\subsection{Adding figures}%
\label{sub:adding_figures}

\paragraph{Paragraph with a figure}%
\label{par:paragraph_with_a_figure}
You can insert figures and easily refer to them.
For instance, \cref{fig:c1_cracking_pattern} contains a cracking pattern generated with the \emph{beam-particle} model in the code \texttt{DEAP}.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{figures/chapter_1/cracking_pattern_pbc_willam_4.jpg}
    \caption{This is a cracking pattern from DEAP. This file has been compressed to be as small a possible.}
    \label{fig:c1_cracking_pattern}
\end{figure}
We recommend placing images files inside the \texttt{figures} directory.
As you can have a lot of figures, we also recommend making a subdirectory for each chapter.

\paragraph{Paragraph with a tikzpicture}%
\label{par:paragraph_with_a_tikzpicture}
You can also add figures using Tikz.
To use Tikz and PGFPlots in this template, you must activate the option \texttt{tikz} in the definition of the document at the beginning of the file \texttt{PhD\_Thesis.tex}.
\Cref{fig:c1_illustrations_symmetry_classes} contains an illustration of the symmetry classes of elasticity tensors in 2D using Tikz.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \tikzsetnextfilename{c1_illustrations_symmetry_classes}
    \input{figures/chapter_1/illustrations_symmetry_classes.tex}
    \caption{A tikz illustration of Symmetry classes and their representative group for 2D elasticity tensors. The illustrations are geometric figures in R2 representative of each of the symmetry classes.}
    \label{fig:c1_illustrations_symmetry_classes}
\end{figure}
\begin{remark}
    If you don't want to use Tikz, you should deactivate the option in the document class at the beginning of the main file.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
    Note that \texttt{tikzpicture} is automatically externalized.
    To avoid any issues, we recommend you to name the \texttt{tikzpicture} using the command \texttt{\textbackslash textsetnextfilename}.
\end{remark}






\section{Doing some bibliography}%
\label{sec:doing_some_bibliography}

\paragraph{Citing papers}%
\label{par:Citing papers}
Using \texttt{biblatex}, you can cite different works.
Here is an example with different thesis using the early version of this template, such as \textcite{cherriere_elaboration_2023,caruel_caracterisation_2023,ruda_methode_2023,abdel_hafiz_etude_2023}, and more recent version of this template \parencite{daby-seesaram_towards_2023,loiseau_formulation_2023}.
Here, you can also cite some articles.
For instance, you can refer to the works of \textcite{wurtzer_premiere_2022,ribeiro_nogueira_differential_2024}.
You can also cite paper in parentheses \parencite{ruda_first_2022,daby-seesaram_hybrid_2023}.
The list of references appears at the very end of the document.
